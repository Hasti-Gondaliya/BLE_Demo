# BLE_Demo - POC of Home Automation over BLE
# What is BLE?
BLE stands for Bluetooth Low Energy, which is a wireless communication technology designed for short-range communication between devices. It is a power-efficient version of the classic Bluetooth technology and is commonly used in various applications such as IoT (Internet of Things), wearables, healthcare devices, and smart home automation.

BLE is specifically designed for low-power devices that require long battery life, making it ideal for applications where energy efficiency is crucial. It operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) band and offers lower data transfer rates compared to classic Bluetooth. However, its low power consumption enables devices to operate for extended periods without frequent battery replacements.

# Project Overview
The project aims to demonstrate the capability of controlling devices using voice commands through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication on a Raspberry Pi. By leveraging the power of voice recognition and the flexibility of BLE, users can interact with various devices wirelessly and conveniently.

The repository includes the necessary code files, libraries, and instructions to set up on devices as a BLE central device and establish communication with peripheral devices. The voice recognition functionality is implemented using a speech-to-text library, enabling users to give voice commands to control connected devices.

The project documentation provides a step-by-step guide on how to set, install the required dependencies, and run the code. It also explains the communication protocol and provides examples of voice commands that can be used to control different devices.
